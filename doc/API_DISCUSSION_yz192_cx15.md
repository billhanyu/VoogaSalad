Our API is designed to be flexible in choices of sprites. We have multiple hierarchies of characters, such as Sprite, Mortal, Mover, Upgrader, Block, etc. 

We use extensive interface design, so that fields and other internal methods for each class is encapsulated. 

I am working on game data, and this part is linked to game engine and game player by functioning essentially as a model.
