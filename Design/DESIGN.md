### Introduction
* Goal: Make a game authoring environment for a 2-d side scrolling platform game
* Flexibility: Level linking, character properties, winning condition, physics settings - support any type of side scrolling game, although not possible to support the most customized games
* Game data is open to both Authoring Environment, which allows users to edit the game, and Game Player & Engine, which use the game information to actually run the game. Authoring Environment and Game Player & Engine are independent of each other.
* Genre: Side scrolling platform game
* Moving background - ability to move if you move to the end of the screen, character always in the center area of the screen, background should be able to move both forwards and backwards
* Physics as an option, like non-physical, or affected by gravity and friction (can be different for different sprites)
* Characters can have potential ability of jumping, climbing, running, walking and interacting each other (e.g. monsters do damage to the player).
* Authoring Environment lets the user to create/modify the game (level, goal, sprites etc), and these information will be stored within a Game object. Game engine use the information to calculate each frame of the game under the hood,  which will be then provided for a game player to run/render the calculated frames.

### Overview

* Our project consists of four parts, game authoring environment, game data, game engine, and game player. 
* Game authoring environment (`AuthorEnvironment` class) supports creating and modifying game data (described in detail below). 
* Game data forms the core of the game, and sufficiently represents a game. It has a physics engine (`PhysicsEngine` class), a game (`Game` class), and a control module (`Control` class). The physics engine specifies how physics works, such as collision behavior, friction, and gravity. The game consists things such as sprites, and level information. The control module specifies how user input is handled. 
* Game engine (`GameEngine` class) takes a set of game data and runs the game. At the highest level, it provides a step() function that steps the game forward by a given elapsed time. This function maps the current state of the game and the user input to the next state of the game. 
* Game player (`GamePlayer` class) takes the game engine and renders the game on the screen. At a certain frame rate, it calls the `step()` function of the game engine, which updates the game data, and shows the resulting game data on the screen.

### Design Details

* INSERT DIAGRAM HERE

* Authoring Environment creates and sets the information of the game. It can create a new Game object, and it can add levels to a game. It has the access to every setter/getter of the Game, Level, Physics Engine, etc. Once a user is done setting all these attributes, the game object will be serialized and saved for later use of the actual game playing.
* GameObject class contains everything that we need for a GameEngine to run. It contains several Level objects, and each Level object has some level specific data, for example sprites and goals.
* GameEngine and GamePlayer are two core parts to the actual game playing program. When the GamePlayer loads a game, it will unpack (re-instantiate) all the classes and hand them to the GameEngine. GameEngine uses the exact GameObject class (and all the classes within it, e.g. Level, Sprites etc) as in Authoring Environment.
* GameEngine essentially implements the step() function, where it is given an timeElapsed and does all the calculation for every sprite of each frame.
* GamePlayer is in charge of calling step() function and does the rendering of each frame based on the information of all the sprites.

### Example Games

* Super Mario Bros.
    * Multiple distinct levels - 8 stage world
    * Game play viewed from side-view camera angle
    * Characters move from left to right
    * One- and two-player
    * Goal to rescue Princess Toadstool from enemy Bowser
    * Coins scattered around game world for players to collect
    * Special bricks marked with question marks
    * Yellow mushroom to double mario size - gives special powers
    * Mario jumps on top of enemies to kill them

* Contra
    * Run and gun-style shoot-em ups
    * Player takes control of an armed commando
    * Fight and kill monsters
    * Also features 3D view where player must move towards the background in order to progress
    * Powerups around game world, replaces the playerâ€™s default weapon with a new one, such as a Laser Gun or a Spread Gun
    * Set number of lives (typically 3)
    * When hit, player loses a life along with any weapon they currently possess

* Flappy Bird
    * Constant motion game
    * Character is constantly falling, so it requires constant user input to keep going
    * Goal is surviving for as long/far as possible
    * Only one input: flapping
    * One player
    * One life
